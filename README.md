Testing SASS

If you are interested you can view my tests online at <https://ivan-developer-01.github.io/sass-test>.

## If you think

### *Yeah, that dude can use .gitignore to ignore the SASS folder...*

If you think so, I'll explain: I didn't use .gitignore because it's a test repository for SASS. Read: *For SASS*. I think you got it now.
